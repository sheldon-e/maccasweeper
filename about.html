    <hr>
	<h3>The purpose of the game is to open all the cells of the board which do not contain a macca. You lose if you set off a macca cell. 
    Every non-macca cell you open will tell you the total number of maccas in the eight neighboring cells. Once you are sure that a cell contains a macca,
    you can right-click to put a flag it on it as a reminder. Once you have flagged all the maccas and cleared all the cells you win!
    To start a new game (abandoning the current one), just click on the new game button.</h3>

    <h3>The game was designed to feel like the traditional minesweeper but with room to grow into something much more. It was actually quite difficult so I spent hours looking into how other persons built theirs. Looking for things I liked in their design as well as things I didn't like or want to be a part of my game. </h3>
